## Summary of Findings

- The durations have a long tails since it is right skewed. I have limited axes to look into distribution. I furtur look for any dependcy based on member or casual
- Even for casual durations have a long tails and right skewed. The most avergae is around 10 min. They have impact on whole data due to more bookings
- Even for members durations have a long tails and right skewed. The most avergae is around 5-8 min. They have impact on whole data due to more bookings
- There are more rides for electric bike than docked. In member type, casual people prefered more electric
- Peak hour is 17 hrs for day wise data comparison with consideration of whole data.
- Most of the rides are taken on Satuday, followed by Tuesday
- When looked into Casual, Saturday has most rides, followed by Sunday. Due to dominative rides from casual, the trend of whole data is mostly followe by casuals
